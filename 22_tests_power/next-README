Write a recursive function unsigned power(unsigned x, unsigned y) which com\
putes x
to the y power.   Note that while 0 to the 0 is undefined in mathematics,
we specify that 0 to the 0 shall be 1 for this function.

Save it into a file called power.c

You MUST use recursion (no iteration).


Use your test-power.c from your previous assignment to test your implementa\
tion
of power. You can symlink the file from the previous assignment into this d\
irectory:

ln -s ../22_tests_power/test-power.c ./

You should then write a Makefile which will compile each C file separately
to an object file, and like them together.
